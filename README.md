# CATFACES-GAN
CATFACES-GAN is a simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate realistic cat faces from random noise. 
This project is based on the seminal paper on Generative Adversarial Networks by Goodfellow et al. (2014), which introduced the GAN architecture.

# Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning model that consists of two neural networks, the generator, and the discriminator, which are trained together in a competitive manner. The generator learns to produce synthetic data (in this case, cat faces) that resembles the real data (cat faces from the dataset), while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake samples.

This project aims to demonstrate a simple GAN implementation for generating realistic cat faces. The generator network takes random noise as input and generates cat faces, and the discriminator network tries to differentiate between the generated cat faces and real cat faces from the dataset.

# GAN Architecture
The GAN architecture consists of two main components:

**Generator**: The generator network takes random noise as input and transforms it into synthetic cat faces. It consists of several layers, including convolutional layers and activation functions, to gradually upsample the noise into the final cat face image.

**Discriminator**: The discriminator network is a binary classifier that aims to distinguish between real cat faces from the dataset and fake cat faces generated by the generator. It also consists of convolutional layers and activation functions to process the input images and make the binary classification.

# Getting Started
To get started with CATFACES-GAN, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/schlafel/CATFACES-GAN.git
- Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Download the cat faces dataset (more details in the Dataset section).
- Train the GAN model (more details in the Training section).
- Generate cat faces using the trained model (more details in the Generated Samples section).


# Dataset
For this project, we require a dataset of real cat faces to train the GAN model effectively. The dataset should consist of a collection of cat face images in a consistent format, preferably square images of equal dimensions.
The data is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models)
# Training
Training the GAN model involves optimizing the generator and discriminator networks iteratively. During training, the generator learns to create more realistic cat faces, while the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish between real and fake cat faces.

To start training, run the following command:

Copy code
````python
python src\train.py
````


# Generated Samples
Once the model is trained, you can generate synthetic cat faces using the following command:

Copy code
````python
python src\generate.py
````
The generated cat faces will be saved. The result looks as follows:

# Evaluation
Evaluating GANs can be a challenging task. Visual inspection of generated samples is a common approach to assessing the quality of the model's output. 
Additionally, you can use quantitative metrics like Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), or Perceptual Path Length (PPL) to evaluate the model's performance further.

# Future Improvements
CATFACES-GAN is a simple GAN implementation to generate cat faces, but there are several ways to improve its performance and output quality. Some potential future improvements include:

- Implementing more advanced GAN architectures like DCGAN, StyleGAN, or BigGAN.
- Using progressive training techniques to stabilize training and generate higher-resolution images.
- Augmenting the dataset with additional cat face images to increase diversity.
- Applying transfer learning from pre-trained GAN models on related tasks.
